      <p>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me <i>(John 14:6)</i>. Before Heavenly Father sent us to earth, He chose Jesus Christ to be our leader and Savior. You chose to follow Jesus Christ before you were born.</p>
      <p>Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to save us. Jesus Christ suffered for our sins so that we can repent and return home safely to live with Heavenly Father. The Savior did something we could not do for ourselves. He was willing to do this because He loves us.</p>

      <p>He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. . . . On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>
      <p>Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</p>

      <p>In Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God as written in the Bible's New Testament, and in mainstream Christian denominations he is God the Son, the second Person in the Trinity. He is believed to be the Jewish messiah (the Christ) who is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, which is called the Old Testament in Christianity.</p>
      <p>It is God the only Son, ever at the Father's side, who has revealed him.” <i>John 20:28</i>“Thomas said in response, 'My Lord and my God!” <i>John 21:17</i> [Peter said,] “Lord, you know everything….”<i>Colossians 2:9 </i>“In Christ the fullness of deity resides in bodily form.”</p>

      <p><i>Psalm 23:1-6</i>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
    <p>Jesus says, “I am the good shepherd” <i>(John 10:11, 14)</i>. The relationship of believers with Jesus Christ is that of sheep to a shepherd. The Lord is our shepherd; we are his flock.</p>

      <p>Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>
      <p>But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</p>
